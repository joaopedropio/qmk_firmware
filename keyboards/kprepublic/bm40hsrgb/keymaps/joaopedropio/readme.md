# My personal keymap

I built this keymap to learn a new layout (which is Colemak-DHm), get used to ortholinear keyboards and eventually switch to a split keyboard like Gergoplex. That's why this layout uses just 36 keys. Heavily inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org#miryoku-) by *manna-harbour*.

# Main Keymap

To simplify things up, I use only 3 layers (besides the gaming layer which I'll talk more about later): Base, Raise (numbers, "simple" symbols and arrows) and Lower (F keys and "programming" symbols). Every layer has home row mods (especifically, [GACS](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods#gacs)).

# Gamming layer (standard planck mit layout)

To access gamming layer just hold RAISE + LOWER + J. To return to base layer, tap LEFT arrow.
